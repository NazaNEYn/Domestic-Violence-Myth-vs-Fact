                                According to the NCADV, victims of domestic violence do not always lack confidence. Talking back or taunting an abuser does not make anyone less of a victim.

                        Victims of domestic violence do not bring violence upon themselves, they do not always lack self-confidence, nor are they just as abusive as the abuser. Violence in relationships occurs when one person feels entitled to power and control over their partner
                        and chooses to use abuse to gain and maintain that control. In relationships where domestic violence exists, violence is not equal. Even if the victim fights back or instigates violence in an effort to diffuse a situation. There
                        is always one person who is the primary, constant source of power, control, and abuse in the relationship.
