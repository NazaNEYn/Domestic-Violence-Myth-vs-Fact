            What Is The Purpose of This Project?
        </h2>
        <p class="p">
            Everything that has happened during/after the <a class="btn" href="https://twitter.com/k4mil1aa/status/1541465411933184005" target="_blank">“Heard
                vs Depp trial”</a>, made me realize how uneducated we all are when it comes to domestic violence.
            <br>
            <!--  -->
            Let me say a few quick words about the trial, first. It was never a dumb fight between two celebrities, nor was it a divorce trial. It stopped being about just them a very long time ago and has become so much more than them.
            <br>
            <!--  -->
            It's been a while since the trial has ended but the victim-blaming, using <a class="btn" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO" target="_blank">Darvo</a> strategy on the victims, spreading misinformation, making memes, mocking
            etc, still continues and it all made a huge negative impact on domestic violence (DV)/Intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors' lives. There are so many concerning myths flying around social media regarding this case and domestic
            violence which is very dangerous.
            <!--  -->
            <br> I think this is such an important issue and in order to make a change and make a safe space for all survivors, this issue needs to be talked about more often. So I decided to do my part in this and build a small project around
            it to raise awareness.
