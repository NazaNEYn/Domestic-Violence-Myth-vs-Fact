                a random survey of one New York county (Nisonoff and Bitamn, 1978, n=296), battered women who sought help for attempted suicide (Oswald, 1980, n=263), a nonrandom survey of help-seeking and non-help-seeking from shelters. (Fojtik,
                1977-78, n=100;Pagelow, 1981, n=267).
