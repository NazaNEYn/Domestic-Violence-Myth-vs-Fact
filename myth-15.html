                                Destroying property around a victim or destroying a victim’s possessions with the intention to control are both abuse. Many domestic violence experts and courts count this as domestic violence.

                        This means that any actions which result in property destruction such as punching a wall or door, destroying an appliance or collectible, setting fire to valuables, etc etc can be considered domestic violence, regardless of whether the property in question
                        is individually owned or jointly owned (as is the case with many marriages). So while criminal charges can be brought against the perpetrator of such actions in most circumstances, it may also be possible (given the right type
                        of relationship between the involved parties) that a temporary restraining order is filed for and granted, something that can potentially result in a final restraining order being entered against the perpetrator as well.
