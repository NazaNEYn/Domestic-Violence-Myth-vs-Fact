                                This is called DARVO, and it’s been used in several murder and abuse cases (OJ Simpson, Brian Laundrie, John Bobbit). Studies show that it’s effective and works well on juries.

                        the abuser. “We find that DARVO works very well with juries but almost never works with judges, who are trained to look at evidence,” Stephens said.
