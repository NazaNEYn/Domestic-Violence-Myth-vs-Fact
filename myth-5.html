                                Many abuse victims use makeup to cover their bruises. Victims will usually hide their bruises because of shame, to protect their abuser, or to go on with their daily life.

                        Before Katey Denno was a Los Angeles-based makeup artist, she spent a decade as a social worker in Virginia, The Bronx, and Washington, DC. Part of her job included covering up clients' bruises using the only thing her shelter had on hand — kids face
                        paint. "Most people felt shame and embarrassment and were sickened that they were wearing this experience on their external [body]," Denno says. "People felt ashamed [and would wonder things like] 'Why do I let my children bear
                        witness?,' 'How come I didn’t see the warning signs?,' [and] 'How come I’m still in love with this person?'"
