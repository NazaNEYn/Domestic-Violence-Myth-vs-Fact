                                Many domestic violence victims still love their abuser after leaving them. Victims that are unable to go no-contact, especially, will still love their abuser for years later.

                        Battered partners or spouses are a prime example of Stockholm syndrome. Oftentimes, they are reluctant to press charges or initiate a restraining order, and some have attempted to stop police from arresting their abusers even after a violent assault.
                        After the relationship has ended, victims of domestic violence may often make statements such as, “I still love him,” even after being brutally beaten.
