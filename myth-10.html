                                Big celebrities that are well liked by the public typically receive more preferential treatment by jurors. Celebrity privilege can easily sway a jury.

                        Theories of social influence can provide an explanation for why celebrities might receive preferential treatment in the courtroom. Social influence refers to a change in the behavior of others due to the use of power by an individual or group. 51 Social
                        power is generally defined as the ability to influence others. 52 Referent power, a specific type of social power, is gained when a person is admired or liked by others. 53 The theory of social power would suggest that celebrities
                        exert referent power because they are typically admired and/or liked. Thus, celebrities have the ability to persuade jurors that they are innocent because they typically possess referent power.
                        <br> The social power that celebrity defendants wield could result in three distinct responses from the jurors judging the case: compliance, identification, and internalization. 54 Compliance involves a person overtly going along
                        with the social influence without internal acceptance. For example, a juror would overtly be influenced by the celebrity's social power without actually changing his private opinion
