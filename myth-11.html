                                This is what’s called a trauma response. It’s very notorious for abusers to act calm and stable in contrast to their victim.

                        The victim might disassociate emotionally, or they might become hyper-emotional. If they’ve always been quite calm or stoic, they might behave in a manner that’s quite unusual for them, such as crying at the drop of a hat or becoming irritable. Some might
                        have difficulty concentrating and feel confused, thus making them seem erratic and unintelligible when they’re speaking. <br> Meanwhile, their abuser is absolutely calm and collected, manipulating the situation
                        like a puppeteer twiddling a marionette’s strings. They seem completely coherent and put together, while the victim is erratic, unstable, even frantic. As a result, the victim gets seen as unhinged while the abuser seems completely
                        rational.
