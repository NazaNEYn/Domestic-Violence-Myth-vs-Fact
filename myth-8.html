                                Jurors are not experts on domestic violence, they are random people that are just as susceptible to victim-blaming tactics by lawyers. A Northwestern University study found that 1 out of 8 juries got it wrong.

                        A new Northwestern University study shows that juries in criminal cases are reaching incorrect verdicts. The study, which looked at 271 cases in four areas of Illinois, found that as many as one in eight juries is making the wrong decision – by convicting
                        an innocent person or acquitting a guilty one.
