## What's This Project About :

#### This project covers the domestice violence issue
There are so many concerning myths flying around social media about domestic violence which are very dangerous.
I think this is such an important issue and in order to make a change and make a safe space for all survivors, this needs to be talked about more often. So I decided to do my part in this and build a small project around it to raise awareness.<br>

I dedicate this project to all of survivors.
