                        Of the intimate partner violence victims who were injured, 34% received some type of medical care, which was slightly less than the percentage of victims injured by immediate family members (41%) and other relatives (50%). An estimated 49% of intimate
                        partner violence victims and 54% of victims of violence by immediate family members who were injured and sought treatment received care in a hospital or medical office. Of the victims who were injured by other relatives and received
                        care, a greater percentage received care in a hospital or medical office (76%) than at the scene, someone’s home, or another location (24%).
